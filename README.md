On this experiment: 
 - I am using Rspec, a TDD tool used to test Ruby code.
 - I have created a basic program in Ruby, that allows to:
    - Keep track of the number of robots created.
    - Create robots AKA objects, with the following characteristics:
        - Name;
        - Made in;
        - Year of assembly;
        - Every newly created robot comes with a fully charged battery at 100% and no damage;
    - Create interactive robots:
        - They can talk;
        - They can give their details;
        - They can say how old they are;
        - They can report their battery level;
        - They can play a song;
        - They can report when they need to be recharged;
        - They can attack each other;

If you want to try it for yourself:
 - Requirements to run: PRY and RSPEC installed on your terminal;
 - Download the repository to your device;
 - Once you have the files, open your terminal on test_root directory;
 - Start by typing #rspec# on the terminal, to run the tests.
 - Alternatively run #rspec --format documentation# to have more information of the actions being tested.
